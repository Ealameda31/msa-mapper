## Requirements

## Installation

## Documentation
Library structure, function documentation, and examples to follow can be found on [this webpage](https://github.com/pages/auth?nonce=05960057-1ca4-42fd-87cd-27ab67de8d84&page_id=27156982&path=Lw).

## Manual Dependencies
Shapefiles are manually uploaded and are located within the internal directory of the library. These files are stored in Git LFS to avoid unnecessary data downloads. They are updated on an infrequent basis (every 10 years) but finding a way to cross-reference the shapefiles programmatically would be ideal.
